# DOM and HTML Parsing

HTML defines the structure of a web page, while the DOM (Document Object Model)
represents that structure as a tree of nodes that programs can interact with.

## DOM Structure
- Elements are arranged hierarchically
- Parent–child relationships define layout
- Text, attributes, and tags form nodes

## Parsing HTML
HTML parsing converts raw markup into a structured format that allows:
- Element selection
- Text extraction
- Attribute access

## Common Selection Techniques
- CSS selectors
- XPath expressions

## Challenges
- Deeply nested elements
- Inconsistent markup
- Frequent layout changes

## Importance in Scraping
Effective DOM parsing allows reliable data extraction without relying on fragile
page layouts.
